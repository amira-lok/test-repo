          be developed through learnable behaviors. We conducted an exhaustive review
          of business and psychological research, identifying a core set of behaviors
          you can develop to become more effective at work. Great employees thrive
          cognitively, socially, and emotionally, and motivate, guide, and include
          others in their roles as formal or informal leaders."
        behaviorsContentWPM1: "At BetterUp we know that leadership is more than simply
          a title or something you are born with. We believe it is a set of learnable
          skills. To better understand this, we conducted an exhaustive review of
          leadership and psychological research, identifying 12 key skills you can
          develop to become a more effective leader. Great leaders bring people together,
          set a clear direction, instill a shared sense of purpose, and create an
          environment where everyone feels motivated to perform at their best."

          around 50, with scores falling above 62 equating to strong performance,
          scores between 38 and 62 signaling average performance and scores below
          38 indicating a development area. In addition, your scores are broken down
          by your own ratings, ratings from your direct manager, direct reports (if
          applicable), and other coworkers to help you compare perceptions across
          these groups."

          scores to a 60 point scale, with scores falling in the top third (41-60)

  challengeDescriptions:
    buildingConfidence: "Managers are constantly navigating unexpected circumstances, often by trial and error. The most self-assured leaders trust their ability to overcome obstacles by treating them as opportunities to grow and practice skills."
    teamCohesion: "Building trust and fostering connections can be difficult for any manager. It’s important to understand how to navigate various personalities and dynamics, and rally team members around shared goals and business priorities."
    developingOthers: "Effective leaders purposely develop and grow the careers of their people. They actively prompt self-discovery, provide constructive feedback, and empower their team members to move towards their professional goals."
    navigatingLayoffs: "Organizational change can create stress about what the future looks like. To sustain team morale and performance, managers need an agile mindset to effectively lead and inspire their teams through uncertainty."
    clarityAndAlignment: "A key job of a leader is aligning a team around a shared vision for the future. It might feel challenging to communicate broader strategic goals that inspire action, especially with shifting team dynamics and business priorities."
    givingFeedback: "When it comes to delivering constructive feedback that’s productively received by your team, the most effective leaders know how to balance empathy and compassion with active listening and an objective perspective."
    decisionMaking: "When it comes to making leadership choices with confidence, it’s not about right or wrong — it’s about strategically evaluating options, committing to a course of action, and staying flexible and growth-oriented as priorities shift."
    stressManagement: "In times of unpredictability, the most effective leaders know that their physical and mental well-being can impact their long-term success, and allocate time to take care of their personal needs and model self-care for their team."
    managingUp: "As managers expand their influence across their organization, they’ll need to cultivate new relationships and embrace what success looks like from a new (and possibly unfamiliar) perspective."
    navigatingUncertainty: "People often struggle with the discomfort of ambiguity and change at work. The most resilient managers know how to turn moments of uncertainty into catalysts for their growth by prioritizing clarity and alignment for their teams."
    navigatingFirstTimeManagement: "A new role comes with a wave of responsibilities, expectations, and pressure to succeed — fast. First-time managers are orienting themselves around new business goals and building foundational skills to effectively lead others."
    performanceReviews: "Performance reviews require managers to reflect on an employee’s impact with feedback that’s unbiased, actionable, and empathetic. To build trust and mutual accountability, it’s critical to set clear expectations of success."

  aboutHow: "How to use this tool"
  aboutHowDescription: "Because the Leadership Style Matrix is state-based, it’s best
    to use this tool to gain initial insights to set the foundation for managerial
    coaching and supporting your direct report. You may notice that as you apply the
    recommended strategies, the needs of your direct report will shift. The best way
    to assess and respond shifts is to periodically ask your direct report:"
  aboutHowList1: "What are your goals?"
  aboutHowList2: "Are you clear on your trajectory?"
  aboutHowList3: "What can I do to help?"
  aboutPlaybook: "The BetterUp Management Playbook"
  aboutState: "State versus Trait"
  aboutStateDescription: "Where an individual falls on the matrix is state-based (versus
    trait), meaning the results reflect your direct report’s needs at a certain point
    in time, and can shift. For example, someone who lands in <strong>Advise</strong>
    (ready to grow, but unclear of direction) may shift to <strong>Coach</strong>
    (ready to grow, and clear on goals) once you’ve provided feedback that increases
    clarity on strengths and growth areas, and as they also gain clarity through BetterUp
    coaching."
  aboutWhat: "What is the Leadership Style Matrix?"
  aboutWhatDescription: "The Leadership Style Matrix was created by our team of in-house
    experts based on models of adaptive leadership, as well as the latest research
    in motivational science. It’s designed to be a practical tool that helps you determine
    your direct report’s current needs quickly, and gives you concrete strategies
    to meet them where they are at. By partnering with BetterUp, we hope to facilitate
    your role as a manager by providing unique insights. We also expect that your
    positive support will amplify the gains your direct report makes through coaching."
  aboutWhy: "Why the Leadership Style Matrix?"
  aboutWhyDescription: "According to Gallup’s ‘State of the Global Workplace’ study,
    63% of employees are unengaged, and only 13% report high engagement. It’s no wonder
    that Deloitte reports ‘retention and engagement’ is the second highest challenge
    on the minds of today’s business leaders. Deloitte also notes the incredible pressure
    on leaders to create what they call “an irresistible organization” in order to
    attract, retain, and keep people engaged.  Quality leadership and opportunities
    for professional development are two of the top strategies for promoting an engaged
    workforce. Most millennials report they want their manager to be more of a coach.
    In order to simplify the task of providing personalized management and managerial
    coaching strategies to your direct reports, we created the Leadership Style Matrix.
    Based on where your direct report falls on the matrix, we recommend specific strategies
    to promote motivation, engagement, and growth."
  adviseDescription: "This direct report will thrive with more challenging tasks,
    and with feedback that will promote self-awareness. Jumping into action and pushing
    growth and development are tempting given this individual’s readiness, but focusing
    on clarity first will help ensure that the trajectory of growth aligns with both
    organizational and personal needs."
  adviseResourceSectionSubhead: "Ready + Explore"
  adviseResourceSectionTitle: "Advise"
  adviseTip1: "Explore this direct report’s goals, ‘stretch goals’, strengths, and
    growth areas in 1:1s."
  adviseTip2: "Provide guidance <em>after</em> allowing them to explore and share
    their ideas."
  adviseTip3: "Help align projects and tasks with development goals."
  adviseTip4: "Provide opportunities for stretch projects that aren’t so difficult
    they become paralyzing (lack of effort and overwhelm are both the enemies of <em>flow</em>)."
  adviseTip5: "Emphasize opportunities for professional development that increases
    self-awareness and goal clarity (such as 360 feedback and coaching)."
  appreciating: "Step 1: Appreciating"
  appreciatingBlurb: "The first step in the appreciative inquiry process is identifying
    strengths and assets at the beginning of the change process by learning from the
    past."
  appreciatingFooter: "The appreciating step achieves two objectives. First, it allows
    you to take stock of what has worked in the past and why. Second, it gets people
    focused on the positive which sets a proactive and inspiring tone."
  appreciatingQuestion: "Example questions for the appreciating stage:"
  appreciatingQuestion1: "When was a time when you felt like you were at your best
    at work?"
  appreciatingQuestion2: "What are your strengths and when are you using them?"
  appreciatingQuestion3: "When are you most excited about your work?"
  appreciatingQuestion4: "What projects have made you feel the most energized in the
    past and why?"
  appreciatingQuestion5: "What have you already accomplished and what allowed you
    to be successful?"
  appreciatingTip: "Be sure to ask follow up and clarifying questions and repeat back
    the themes that you observe. The more specific you can get people to be about
    the details of their experience the better."
  appreciativeInquiry: "Coaching Skills for Managers: Appreciative Inquiry"
  appreciativeInquiryBlurb: "Learn how to facilitate positive change for individuals,
    teams, and organizations using the questioning techniques of appreciative inquiry."
  appreciativeInquiryFooter: "Using questions rather than suggestions may be an unfamiliar
    change strategy at first, but give it a try and see what results you get. It may
    take a bit more time but you may be surprised by the positive energy and enthusiasm
    the appreciative inquiry process can generate."
  appreciativeInquiryExample: "Examples of when appreciative inquiry can be used as
    a manager:"
  appreciativeInquiryExample1: "When providing one-on-one coaching with a direct report."
  appreciativeInquiryExample2: "To help a team operate and communicate more effectively."
  appreciativeInquiryExample3: "When building a new team, project, or business."
  appreciativeInquiryExample4: "When managing a change effort with many stakeholders."
  appreciativeInquiryExample5: "When getting people who have different areas of expertise
    to collaborate effectively."
  appreciativeInquiryIntro1: "Appreciative inquiry is an approach to creating change
    by using questions to cultivate a positive image of what’s possible. You can utilize
    this technique as a manager to support positive change for direct reports, teams,
    and your broader organization. That said, it can be a critical skill when it comes
    to developing one’s capacity for managerial coaching. It was developed by David
    Cooperrider from Case Western Reserve University and is used globally within organizations
    of all sizes to enact long-lasting positive change."
  appreciativeInquiryIntro2: "How does it work? An appreciative approach means that
    you help others to find and leverage learnings from “peak experiences” and help
    them develop an inspiring vision for the future using positively focused open-ended
    questions."
  appreciativeInquiryStage: "There are four stages to the appreciative inquiry process:"
  appreciativeInquiryStage1: "<strong>Appreciating:</strong> identifying the best
    of what is."
  appreciativeInquiryStage2: "<strong>Envisioning:</strong> imagining what is possible."
  appreciativeInquiryStage3: "<strong>Co-constructing:</strong> strategizing how to
    get there."
  appreciativeInquiryStage4: "<strong>Sustaining:</strong> planning how follow through
    and adapt."
  browseBetterUp: "Browse BetterUp’s best practices and tips for the following situations:"
  clarify: "<strong>Clarify.</strong> Acknowledge what they shared with you about
    how you can best support them on their coaching journey. Clarify any points of
    confusion. Ask them if they have any questions about the feedback you shared.
    For easy reference, you can access the feedback you shared from the Manager Dashboard!"
  coachDescription: "Keep this person engaged and leverage their readiness and clarity
    for growth by asking powerful questions, using active listening, and providing
    goal-related challenges. When managing this individual: offer autonomy to allow
    plenty of room for growth, provide frequent feedback to encourage new skill development,
    and help define meaningful ‘stretch goals’. Although this individual has a sense
    of clarity around goals, don’t hesitate to provide opportunities for additional
    ‘data points’ and perspectives through professional development and feedback."
  coachResourceSectionSubhead: "Ready + Focus"
  coachResourceSectionTitle: "Coach"
  coachTip1a: "Discuss goals, motivators, strengths, and values in 1:1s. This will
    help leverage and amplify existing clarity."
  coachTip1b: "Not sure where to start? Here’s some questions to try:"
  coachTip1b1: "When are you most satisfied at work?"
  coachTip1b2: "What are your desired areas of growth?"
  coachTip1b3: "Do you find you have the right level of challenge in your balance
    of tasks?"
  coachTip2: "If the team is already thriving, consider offering this individual 10-20%
    time to pursue an audacious, yet meaningful, ‘stretch goal’."
  coachTip3: "Encourage risk taking by creating an environment in which it is okay
    to fail. By definition, ‘stretch goals’ are highly challenging and somewhat risky.
    In order to feel safe taking the leap, encourage the attitude that the only true
    failure is not learning from experience."
  coachTip4: "Let them know you are available for frequent feedback, and give it in
    real time to they can learn from each project what is working, and what to do
    differently. Don’t wait the quarterly or yearly review!"
  coachTip5: "Ask direct report which of their tasks successfully stretch and challenge,
    without overwhelming. These tasks will help promote <em>flow</em>. However, when
    considering the overall load, remember that ‘overwhelm’ is the enemy of flow."
  confidentiality: "3. Respect confidentiality"
  confidentialityBlurb: "It is important to respect the confidentiality of the coaching
    process. As a manager, it is important to respect the coach/coachee relationship
    and resist any temptation to control the coaching process. While your direct report
    will partner with their coach to integrate your feedback into their development
    plan, it is ultimately the coachee who determines goals and drives the process.
    Here’s a few things you can do to ensure you are supporting your direct report,
    without interfering:"
  confidentialityList1: "Allow your direct report to share details about the coaching
    experience on their own terms."
  confidentialityList2: "Rather than telling your direct report what to work on, provide
    feedback to help inform the process."
  confidentialityList3: "Avoid asking questions that would make your direct report
    feel pressured to disclose information that may be sensitive."
  confidentialityTip: "Remember, we are more motivated when we set our own goals.
    As a manager, it is best to support rather than direct the coaching process."
  constructing: "Step 3: Co-constructing"
  constructingBlurb: "The co-constructing stage is all about generating strategies
    and getting creative about how to achieve the vision that was identified during
    the previous stages. At this stage you want to continue to push the boundaries
    of what others think is possible, but still hold onto what was inspiring about
    the original vision."
  constructingFooter: "As a manager, during the co-constructing stage of the appreciative
    inquiry process you can help identify creative yet realistic strategies for how
    to get from where they are now to where they want to be."
  constructingQuestion: "Example questions for the co-constructing stage:"
  constructingQuestion1: "Imagine that you have already been successful. What did
    you do to get there?"
  constructingQuestion2: "What are some possible pathways to achieving your vision?"
  constructingQuestion3: "What will you have to learn or do differently in order to
    be successful?"
  constructingQuestion4: "Who else could help you along the way and how can you get
    them onboard?"
  constructingQuestion5: "Where can you create win-wins by collaborating with others?"
  constructingTip: "Bring in the themes that you identified during the appreciating
    phase so they can best leverage their experience, strengths, and resources."
  discussFeedback: "1. Discuss feedback"
  discussFeedbackBlurb: "Create space in your next 1:1 to discuss the feedback that

    with your your direct report. You may do some or all of the following:"
  encourageDescription: "Demonstrating a genuine interest, but not a ‘pushy’ interest,
    in this individual’s preferred course of professional development will help develop
    rapport, and create a positive foundation for future growth. While this individual
    has clarity around specific potential growth areas, it may not be exactly the
    right time to pursue that growth. For now, keep discussions and feedback largely
    focused on the most important aspects of this individual’s role. Keep feedback
    relevant to top priorities."

  encourageTip1: "Discuss their top strengths. Ask about what they see as their top
    three strengths at work, and share the strengths that you notice."
  encourageTip2: "Ask about skills they’d like to build, and talk about prioritizing
    tasks and projects that align with their goals."
  encourageTip3: "Celebrate small wins! When your direct report has an achievement,
    small or large, convey enthusiasm and support."
  encourageTip4: "Before sharing feedback, ask permission. This type of question allows
    your direct report to build autonomy, deepen trust with you, and will ultimately
    support future growth. In the same vein, provide choices when it comes to professional
    development, letting them determine the opportunities that best resonate with
    their goals and personal preferences."
  encourageTip5: "Provide opportunities for professional development, such as coaching,

  envisioning: "Step 2: Envisioning"
  envisioningBlurb: "The purpose of the envisioning stage is to develop a shared vision
    of what is possible by amplifying the positive. This allows you to generate ideas
    and begin to craft a positive collective direction toward an inspiring outcome."
  envisioningFooter: "Once you have a clear vision of what is possible, help the group
    or individual focus by deciding which areas or goals are most compelling, valued,
    or inspiring for them right now. It should be those that the individual feels
    energized by."
  envisioningQuestion: "Example questions for the envisioning stage:"
  envisioningQuestion1: "What could you accomplish if you fully leveraged your skills
    and resources?"
  envisioningQuestion2: "How can you take what is already working well and amplify
    it?"
  envisioningQuestion3: "What is possible if you took full advantage of this opportunity?"

  focusDescription: "‘Focus’ indicates self-awareness of what one needs to do in order
    to grow in one’s current role. That self-awareness serves as the perfect starting
    point for development, and can be supported by additional feedback from manager.
    ‘Explore’ indicates a lack of awareness and clarity when it comes to strengths
    and growth areas related to their role. It’s important not to mistake a lack of
    clarity for a lack of willingness."

    guidance for how to best inspire and support their direct reports so they can
    achieve their full potential. In order for leaders to grow their capacity to bring
    out the best in their direct reports, we created the Leadership Style Matrix that
    identifies specific support behaviors that will best match the needs of your direct
    reports. Knowing where your direct report lands on the Leadership Style Matrix
    will help you manage them in a fashion that helps maximize their growth and potential.
    Please keep in mind that the matrix reflects your direct report’s state at a certain
    point in time, and can change through effective leadership and coaching. Please
    also note that this is intended to be a guiding framework. We know most individuals
    don’t fit neatly into boxes, and would advise you to trust your expertise and
    test your assumptions!"

  makeAvailable: "2. Make yourself available"
  makeAvailableBlurb: "Your openness in the first feedback conversation sets the stage
    for the conversation to continue. While your direct report is responsible for
    driving their own development, you can help by providing ample opportunity for
    them to engage your support and mentorship."
  makeAvailableList: "Some example questions you can use to have a development conversation
    with your direct report during the coaching process include:"
  makeAvailableList1: "How is the coaching process going for you?"
  makeAvailableList2: "What can I do to best support your development?"
  makeAvailableList3: "What feedback can I provide to best support your growth?"
  makeAvailableList4: "How frequently would you like to check-in to discuss your coaching

  makeAvailableTip: "Committing to weekly 1:1s, in order to discuss specific tasks
    and overall progress, is a well known best practice for managers. In addition,
    BetterUp recommends having dedicated one-on-one conversations that are focused
    on your direct report’s development at least once every 4 months."
  readyDescription: "‘Ready’ indicates that an individual is currently seeking professional
    growth and development, while ‘Steady’ indicates that an individual is not currently
    focused on seeking out new growth and development goals. It’s important to note
    that the ‘Steady’ phase serves a valuable purpose (increasing mastery <em>within</em>

    feedback primarily on the tasks and behaviors that are most important for their
    role; this is a period to develop mastery within their current position."
  reinforceResourceSectionSubhead: "Steady + Explore"
  reinforceTip1: "Praise positive behavior when you observe it. For example, if an
    individual does excellent work on a monthly report, be sure to praise their effort.
    Recognizing excellence provides a strong and stable foundation for direct reports
    to take more risks and challenges in the future."
  reinforceTip2: "In 1:1s, when conveying new tasks, expectations, or feedback, make
    sure you are clear. For instance, if you really want this individual to communication
    progress in a specific format, let them know. To make sure you’ve achieved clarity,
    ask them what they see as the next steps, and also give them a chance to respond
    and ask questions."
  reinforceTip3: "Make sure to keep it specific and actionable. For instance, rather
    than a general “good job”, share what specific behaviors you observed that you
    thought were positive or negative, how those behaviors will impact the outcome
    of their work, and recommendations for what to do in in the future."
  reinforceTip4: "Recommend professional development opportunities that are optional
    and personalized. When a direct report is in the driver’s seat guiding development
    at their own pace, it can promote motivation (similar to coaching!) which will
    in turn lead to greater clarity and readiness."

    like to use time in your 1:1."
  support: "4. Demonstrate support"
  supportBlurb: "Expressing support for your direct report’s development shows that
    they are a valued member of your team and sets the expectation that they can dedicate
    time and energy to the coaching process. Coaching, like most other forms of development,
    only allows you to get out what you put into the process. As a manager, you can
    inspire your direct reports to perform at a level that they would have never imagined
    of themselves by expressing your confidence in their capabilities and encouraging
    them to continually learn."
  supportList: "Here are a few specific ways to offer support:"
  supportList1: "Encourage your direct report to take time for coaching and professional
    development within working hours."
  supportList2: "Provide honest positive feedback when you observe high quality performance
    or progress."
  supportList3: "Point out strengths that you notice in your direct report. Let them
    know how their strengths contribute to the overall goals of your team and your
    organization."
  supportList4: "Offer your time, expertise, or resources to help support your direct
    report’s personal growth."
  supportTip: "People are impacted by the expectations that others have for them.
    This is known by psychologists as the Pygmalion effect. Help others to be their
    best self and you may be surprised at what they can achieve."
  sustaining: "Step 4: Sustaining"
  sustainingBlurb: "The sustaining phase of the appreciative inquiry process is the
    final stage and is focused on making the plans a reality through execution and
    adaptation. The inquiry process at this stage is focused on developing clear and
    actionable steps to take in order to bring the vision into reality."
  sustainingFooter: "It is important for you as a manager to cultivate the enthusiasm
    and vision of others rather than drive the process. The sustaining force behind
    the inquiry process is not your authority but the positive emotions that pursuing
    a meaningful challenge creates."
  sustainingQuestion: "Example questions for this stage:"
  sustainingQuestion1: "What would a step-by-step plan be for accomplishing this goal?"
  sustainingQuestion2: "What can you do today to begin the process of making this
    vision a reality?"
  sustainingQuestion3: "What needs to happen in order for your vision to come to fruition?"
  sustainingQuestion4: "What potential roadblocks might come up and how will you address
    them?"
  sustainingQuestion5: "How can you hold yourself accountable for following through?"

  feedbackBlurb: "65% of employees want more feedback, yet research shows most feedback
    is ineffective. Check out our 3 strategies for sharing quality feedback that boosts
    performance."
  feedbackIntro: "Few would argue that creating a culture of effective feedback boosts
    organizational and employee effectiveness. In fact, a recent study by Harvard
    Business Review finds a direct correlation between effective feedback and employee
    engagement. While we intuitively understand the importance of feedback, research
    shows that feedback rarely leads to significant gains in performance. That’s because
    much of the time we aren’t giving quality feedback at the right time. Fortunately,
    feedback is a developable skill, and our experience at BetterUp shows it’s a skill
    that managers are keen to improve upon. Continue on for actionable strategies
    that you can employ to help ensure your feedback is understood and implemented!"

  goalsTitle: "The Secret Sauce to Goal Setting is Confidence"
  goalsBlurb: "Learn more about the connection between goal setting and self confidence,
    and how you can work with your direct reports to set goals that enhance their
    mastery."
  goalsIntroParagraph1: "While many managers understand SMART goals, CLEAR goals,
    or other popular frameworks, few have the expertise required to work with their
    direct reports to set goals that support mastery, confidence, and skill building.
    While goal setting frameworks are invaluable for increasing the likelihood of
    task completion, supporting mastery is what will really leverage the full potential
    of your team over time."
  goalsIntroParagraph2: "Fortunately, inspiring mastery as a leader is a developable
    skill. To start, it helps to understand how confidence develops. In peak performance
    psychology, confidence can be referred to as ‘self-efficacy’. Self-efficacy is
    the belief in one’s own ability to succeed. One’s level of self-efficacy influences
    how they approach goals and challenges and is therefore foundational to successful
    goal setting."
  goalsBodyHeadline: "What does this mean for me as a manager?"
  goalsBodyParagraph1: "Although the video speaks to all individuals, let’s see how
    you can apply strategies for developing confidence, self efficacy, and mastery
    through collaborative goal setting with your direct reports."

  goalsListTipTitle: "Tip"
  goalsList1Bold: "Focus on strengths:"
  goalsList1Copy: "Aligning goals and tasks with the unique strengths of each individual
    boosts engagement. According to psychologist Lea Waters a strength is defined
    by performance (one is good at at it), use (one is naturally drawn to use it),
    and energy (using that skill is energizing vs depleting). As a society, we tend
    to focus more on overcoming weakness than further leveraging and celebrating strengths,
    so it may take some work for your direct report determine which tasks at work
    are most in their wheelhouse."
  goalsList1Tip: "One practice coaches use to help an individual discover the tasks
    that best leverage their strengths is to conduct an ‘energy audit’ (remember,
    one characteristic of strengths is that applying them is energizing). To execute
    this, have them write down all of their tasks at work, and to note which tasks
    feel ‘energizing’ and which tasks feel ‘depleting’. Even if it’s not possible
    to eliminate tasks that drain, work with your direct report to craft a balance
    between that which enlivens and that which depletes."
  goalsList2Bold: "Positive communication:"
  goalsList2Copy: "In the video, we see how positive self-talk influences success
    for any individual. How this translates to managers is that the way you speak
    to your direct reports matters, and can contribute to their sense of self-efficacy."
  goalsList2Tip: "One powerful way to do this is by focusing on their ‘strengths’
    rather than ‘deficits’. When discussing a project, point out how you see them
    applying their strengths in a way that elevates that the output. This will be
    more effective, and more motivating, than focusing on deficits."
  goalsList3Bold: "Set SMART goals:"
  goalsList3Copy: "SMART goals, a familiar framework for many, are goals that are
    Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound. As we saw in the video,
    Practicing a task, at increasing, yet manageable, levels of challenge, is one
    of the best ways to increase self-efficacy and mastery. As a manager, support
    this by working with your direct report to set goals that are SMART. Encourage
    your direct report to to ‘raise the red flag’ if a goal feels unrealistic or unachievable,
    and help them break it down into smaller chunks. Make sure to celebrate small
    wins along the way."

          all'. Research indicates that achieving an adequate balance for each individual
          results in positive benefits for both individuals and their organizations.
          Organizations should seek to create a culture and environment that fosters

          Stress can be caused by work and non-work demands. While it is unavoidable,
          individuals can change how they view the stressor and even their bodily
          responses to stress so that they can thrive under momentary stress. However,
          chronic stress can cause many negative outcomes, such as health problems."

          as a result of work and non-work demands."
        businessImpactDescription: "High levels of stress at the individual level
          can lead to poor well-being, mental health issues, and physical illness.
          For organizations, high levels of stress are associated with absenteeism,

        metricDescription: "Performance is one of the most critical, though multi-facetted,
          set of behaviors by which individuals contribute to organizational goals."
        inActionDescription: "Job performance is the collection of behaviors that
          are aimed at advancing goals at work. Job performance isn't the entirety

          eligible for evaluation as either positively contributing or negatively
          contributing to organizatonal effectiveness. It's the work that drives results.
          Importantly, though, the results from one's work is not the same as performance
          because results are often influenced by context and conditions well beyond
          the individual's control. When we talk about job performance, we mean the
          behavior and actions under the individual's control to drive impact and
