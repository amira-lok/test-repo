You may notice that as you apply the recommended strategies, the needs of your direct report will shift. The best way to assess and respond shifts is to periodically ask your direct report:'

        aboutStateDescription: 'Where an individual falls on the matrix is state-based (versus trait), meaning the results reflect your direct report’s needs at a certain point in time, and can shift. For example, someone who lands in <strong>Advise</strong> (ready to grow, but unclear of direction) may shift to <strong>Coach</strong> (ready to grow, and clear on goals) once you’ve provided feedback that increases clarity on strengths and growth areas, and as they also gain clarity through BetterUp coaching.'
        aboutSubhead: 'Background on BetterUp’s approach to personalized leadership development and how coaching works'
        aboutWhat: 'What is the Leadership Style Matrix?'
        aboutWhatDescription: 'The Leadership Style Matrix was created by our team of in-house experts based on models of adaptive leadership, as well as the latest research in motivational science. It’s designed to be a practical tool that helps you determine your direct report’s current needs quickly, and gives you concrete strategies to meet them where they are at. By partnering with BetterUp, we hope to facilitate your role as a manager by providing unique insights. We also expect that your positive support will amplify the gains your direct report makes through coaching.'
        aboutWhy: 'Why the Leadership Style Matrix?'
        aboutWhyDescription: 'According to Gallup’s ‘State of the Global Workplace’ study, 63% of employees are unengaged, and only 13% report high engagement. It’s no wonder that Deloitte reports ‘retention and engagement’ is the second highest challenge on the minds of today’s business leaders. Deloitte also notes the incredible pressure on leaders to create what they call “an irresistible organization” in order to attract, retain, and keep people engaged.  Quality leadership and opportunities for professional development are two of the top strategies for promoting an engaged workforce. Most millennials report they want their manager to be more of a coach. In order to simplify the task of providing personalized management and managerial coaching strategies to your direct reports, we created the Leadership Style Matrix. Based on where your direct report falls on the matrix, we recommend specific strategies to promote motivation, engagement, and growth.'
        adviseDescription: 'This direct report will thrive with more challenging tasks, and with feedback that will promote self-awareness. Jumping into action and pushing growth and development are tempting given this individual’s readiness, but focusing on clarity first will help ensure that the trajectory of growth aligns with both organizational and personal needs.'

        appreciating: 'Step 1: Appreciating'
        appreciatingBlurb: 'The first step in the appreciative inquiry process is identifying strengths and assets at the beginning of the change process by learning from the past.'
        appreciatingFooter: 'The appreciating step achieves two objectives. First, it allows you to take stock of what has worked in the past and why. Second, it gets people focused on the positive which sets a proactive and inspiring tone.'
        appreciatingQuestion: 'Example questions for the appreciating stage:'
        appreciatingQuestion1: 'When was a time when you felt like you were at your best at work?'
        appreciatingQuestion2: 'What are your strengths and when are you using them?'
        appreciatingQuestion3: 'When are you most excited about your work?'
        appreciatingQuestion4: 'What projects have made you feel the most energized in the past and why?'
        appreciatingQuestion5: 'What have you already accomplished and what allowed you to be successful?'

        appreciativeInquiryExample1: 'When providing one-on-one coaching with a direct report.'
        appreciativeInquiryExample2: 'To help a team operate and communicate more effectively.'
        appreciativeInquiryExample3: 'When building a new team, project, or business.'

        appreciativeInquiryExample5: 'When getting people who have different areas of expertise to collaborate effectively.'
        appreciativeInquiryFooter: 'Using questions rather than suggestions may be an unfamiliar change strategy at first, but give it a try and see what results you get. It may take a bit more time but you may be surprised by the positive energy and enthusiasm the appreciative inquiry process can generate.'
        appreciativeInquiryIntro1: 'Appreciative inquiry is an approach to creating change by using questions to cultivate a positive image of what’s possible. You can utilize this technique as a manager to support positive change for direct reports, teams, and your broader organization. That said, it can be a critical skill when it comes to developing one’s capacity for managerial coaching. It was developed by David Cooperrider from Case Western Reserve University and is used globally within organizations of all sizes to enact long-lasting positive change.'
        appreciativeInquiryIntro2: 'How does it work? An appreciative approach means that you help others to find and leverage learnings from “peak experiences” and help them develop an inspiring vision for the future using positively focused open-ended questions.'
        appreciativeInquiryStage: 'There are four stages to the appreciative inquiry process:'
        appreciativeInquiryStage1: '<strong>Appreciating:</strong> identifying the best of what is.'
        appreciativeInquiryStage2: '<strong>Envisioning:</strong> imagining what is possible.'
        appreciativeInquiryStage3: '<strong>Co-constructing:</strong> strategizing how to get there.'

        coachDescription: 'Keep this person engaged and leverage their readiness and clarity for growth by asking powerful questions, using active listening, and providing goal-related challenges. When managing this individual: offer autonomy to allow plenty of room for growth, provide frequent feedback to encourage new skill development, and help define meaningful ‘stretch goals’. Although this individual has a sense of clarity around goals, don’t hesitate to provide opportunities for additional ‘data points’ and perspectives through professional development and feedback.'

        coachTip2: 'If the team is already thriving, consider offering this individual 10-20% time to pursue an audacious, yet meaningful, ‘stretch goal’.'
        coachTip3: 'Encourage risk taking by creating an environment in which it is okay to fail. By definition, ‘stretch goals’ are highly challenging and somewhat risky. In order to feel safe taking the leap, encourage the attitude that the only true failure is not learning from experience.'
        coachTip4: 'Let them know you are available for frequent feedback, and give it in real time to they can learn from each project what is working, and what to do differently. Don’t wait the quarterly or yearly review!'
        coachTip5: 'Ask direct report which of their tasks successfully stretch and challenge, without overwhelming. These tasks will help promote <em>flow</em>. However, when considering the overall load, remember that ‘overwhelm’ is the enemy of flow.'
        confidentiality: '3. Respect confidentiality'
        confidentialityBlurb: 'It is important to respect the confidentiality of the coaching process. As a manager, it is important to respect the coach/coachee relationship and resist any temptation to control the coaching process. While your direct report will partner with their coach to integrate your feedback into their development plan, it is ultimately the coachee who determines goals and drives the process. Here’s a few things you can do to ensure you are supporting your direct report, without interfering:'
        confidentialityList1: 'Allow your direct report to share details about the coaching experience on their own terms.'
        confidentialityList2: 'Rather than telling your direct report what to work on, provide feedback to help inform the process.'
        confidentialityList3: 'Avoid asking questions that would make your direct report feel pressured to disclose information that may be sensitive.'
        confidentialityTip: 'Remember, we are more motivated when we set our own goals. As a manager, it is best to support rather than direct the coaching process.'
        constructing: 'Step 3: Co-constructing'
        constructingBlurb: 'The co-constructing stage is all about generating strategies and getting creative about how to achieve the vision that was identified during the previous stages. At this stage you want to continue to push the boundaries of what others think is possible, but still hold onto what was inspiring about the original vision.'
        constructingFooter: 'As a manager, during the co-constructing stage of the appreciative inquiry process you can help identify creative yet realistic strategies for how to get from where they are now to where they want to be.'
        constructingQuestion: 'Example questions for the co-constructing stage:'
        constructingQuestion1: 'Imagine that you have already been successful. What did you do to get there?'
        constructingQuestion2: 'What are some possible pathways to achieving your vision?'
        constructingQuestion3: 'What will you have to learn or do differently in order to be successful?'

        discussFeedback: '1. Discuss feedback'
        discussFeedbackBlurb: 'Create space in your next 1:1 to discuss the feedback that you and your direct report exchanged. How you go about this depends on your relationship with your your direct report. You may do some or all of the following:'
        encourageDescription: 'Demonstrating a genuine interest, but not a ‘pushy’ interest, in this individual’s preferred course of professional development will help develop rapport, and create a positive foundation for future growth. While this individual has clarity around specific potential growth areas, it may not be exactly the right time to pursue that growth. For now, keep discussions and feedback largely focused on the most important aspects of this individual’s role. Keep feedback relevant to top priorities.'

        encourageTip3: 'Celebrate small wins! When your direct report has an achievement, small or large, convey enthusiasm and support.'
        encourageTip4: 'Before sharing feedback, ask permission. This type of question allows your direct report to build autonomy, deepen trust with you, and will ultimately support future growth. In the same vein, provide choices when it comes to professional development, letting them determine the opportunities that best resonate with their goals and personal preferences.'
        encourageTip5: 'Provide opportunities for professional development, such as coaching, conferences, or 360 feedback; whenever possible, make these optional.'
        envisioning: 'Step 2: Envisioning'
        envisioningBlurb: 'The purpose of the envisioning stage is to develop a shared vision of what is possible by amplifying the positive. This allows you to generate ideas and begin to craft a positive collective direction toward an inspiring outcome.'
        envisioningFooter: 'Once you have a clear vision of what is possible, help the group or individual focus by deciding which areas or goals are most compelling, valued, or inspiring for them right now. It should be those that the individual feels energized by.'

        feedbackDigDeeper: 'Dig deeper'
        feedbackDigDeeperCopy: 'When you feel confident providing quality feedback to individual direct reports, think about taking other actions to contribute to creating a ''culture of feedback''. As with most great goals, the first step is looking within.

        feedbackIntro: 'Few would argue that creating a culture of effective feedback boosts organizational and employee effectiveness. In fact, a recent study by Harvard Business Review finds a direct correlation between effective feedback and employee engagement. While we intuitively understand the importance of feedback, research shows that feedback rarely leads to significant gains in performance. That’s because much of the time we aren’t giving quality feedback at the right time. Fortunately, feedback is a developable skill, and our experience at BetterUp shows it’s a skill that managers are keen to improve upon. Continue on for actionable strategies that you can employ to help ensure your feedback is understood and implemented!'

        feedbackTipTitle: Tip
        focusDescription: '‘Focus’ indicates self-awareness of what one needs to do in order to grow in one’s current role. That self-awareness serves as the perfect starting point for development, and can be supported by additional feedback from manager. ‘Explore’ indicates a lack of awareness and clarity when it comes to strengths and growth areas related to their role. It’s important not to mistake a lack of clarity for a lack of willingness.'

        goalsBodyHeadline: 'What does this mean for me as a manager?'
        goalsBodyParagraph1: 'Although the video speaks to all individuals, let’s see how you can apply strategies for developing confidence, self efficacy, and mastery through collaborative goal setting with your direct reports.'
        goalsContinue: 'Continue learning'
        goalsIntroParagraph1: 'While many managers understand SMART goals, CLEAR goals, or other popular frameworks, few have the expertise required to work with their direct reports to set goals that support mastery, confidence, and skill building. While goal setting frameworks are invaluable for increasing the likelihood of task completion, supporting mastery is what will really leverage the full potential of your team over time.'
        goalsIntroParagraph2: 'Fortunately, inspiring mastery as a leader is a developable skill. To start, it helps to understand how confidence develops. In peak performance psychology, confidence can be referred to as ‘self-efficacy’. Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s own ability to succeed. One’s level of self-efficacy influences how they approach goals and challenges and is therefore foundational to successful goal setting.'
        goalsList1Bold: 'Focus on strengths:'
        goalsList1Copy: 'Aligning goals and tasks with the unique strengths of each individual boosts engagement. According to psychologist Lea Waters a strength is defined by performance (one is good at at it), use (one is naturally drawn to use it), and energy (using that skill is energizing vs depleting). As a society, we tend to focus more on overcoming weakness than further leveraging and celebrating strengths, so it may take some work for your direct report determine which tasks at work are most in their wheelhouse.'
        goalsList1Tip: 'One practice coaches use to help an individual discover the tasks that best leverage their strengths is to conduct an ‘energy audit’ (remember, one characteristic of strengths is that applying them is energizing). To execute this, have them write down all of their tasks at work, and to note which tasks feel ‘energizing’ and which tasks feel ‘depleting’. Even if it’s not possible to eliminate tasks that drain, work with your direct report to craft a balance between that which enlivens and that which depletes.'
        goalsList2Bold: 'Positive communication:'
        goalsList2Copy: 'In the video, we see how positive self-talk influences success for any individual. How this translates to managers is that the way you speak to your direct reports matters, and can contribute to their sense of self-efficacy.'
        goalsList2Tip: 'One powerful way to do this is by focusing on their ‘strengths’ rather than ‘deficits’. When discussing a project, point out how you see them applying their strengths in a way that elevates that the output. This will be more effective, and more motivating, than focusing on deficits.'
        goalsList3Bold: 'Set SMART goals:'
        goalsList3Copy: 'SMART goals, a familiar framework for many, are goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound. As we saw in the video, Practicing a task, at increasing, yet manageable, levels of challenge, is one of the best ways to increase self-efficacy and mastery. As a manager, support this by working with your direct report to set goals that are SMART. Encourage your direct report to to ‘raise the red flag’ if a goal feels unrealistic or unachievable, and help them break it down into smaller chunks. Make sure to celebrate small wins along the way.'

        leadership: 'Leadership Styles'
        leadershipAbout: 'The Leadership Style Matrix is designed to provide managers with guidance for how to best inspire and support their direct reports so they can achieve their full potential. In order for leaders to grow their capacity to bring out the best in their direct reports, we created the Leadership Style Matrix that identifies specific support behaviors that will best match the needs of your direct reports. Knowing where your direct report lands on the Leadership Style Matrix will help you manage them in a fashion that helps maximize their growth and potential. Please keep in mind that the matrix reflects your direct report’s state at a certain point in time, and can change through effective leadership and coaching. Please also note that this is intended to be a guiding framework. We know most individuals don’t fit neatly into boxes, and would advise you to trust your expertise and test your assumptions!'
        leadershipDescription: 'Use our Leadership Style Matrix and related recommended strategies to tailor your leadership style to the unique needs of your direct reports.'

        makeAvailable: '2. Make yourself available'
        makeAvailableBlurb: 'Your openness in the first feedback conversation sets the stage for the conversation to continue. While your direct report is responsible for driving their own development, you can help by providing ample opportunity for them to engage your support and mentorship.'
        makeAvailableList: 'Some example questions you can use to have a development conversation with your direct report during the coaching process include:'
        makeAvailableList1: 'How is the coaching process going for you?'
        makeAvailableList2: 'What can I do to best support your development?'
        makeAvailableList3: 'What feedback can I provide to best support your growth?'
        makeAvailableList4: 'How frequently would you like to check-in to discuss your coaching experience?'
        makeAvailableTip: 'Committing to weekly 1:1s, in order to discuss specific tasks and overall progress, is a well known best practice for managers. In addition, BetterUp recommends having dedicated one-on-one conversations that are focused on your direct report’s development at least once every 4 months.'
        readyDescription: '‘Ready’ indicates that an individual is currently seeking professional growth and development, while ‘Steady’ indicates that an individual is not currently focused on seeking out new growth and development goals. It’s important to note that the ‘Steady’ phase serves a valuable purpose (increasing mastery <em>within</em> role), and when supported, contributes to a higher level of sustainable professional development over time.'
        readyHeader: 'Ready versus Steady'
        reinforceDescription: 'Using light-touch reinforcement techniques, you can provide valuable direction without overwhelming. When managing this individual, focus feedback primarily on the tasks and behaviors that are most important for their role; this is a period to develop mastery within their current position.'

        reinforceResourceSectionTitle: Reinforce
        reinforceTip1: 'Praise positive behavior when you observe it. For example, if an individual does excellent work on a monthly report, be sure to praise their effort. Recognizing excellence provides a strong and stable foundation for direct reports to take more risks and challenges in the future.'
        reinforceTip2: 'In 1:1s, when conveying new tasks, expectations, or feedback, make sure you are clear. For instance, if you really want this individual to communication progress in a specific format, let them know. To make sure you’ve achieved clarity, ask them what they see as the next steps, and also give them a chance to respond and ask questions.'
        reinforceTip3: 'Make sure to keep it specific and actionable. For instance, rather than a general “good job”, share what specific behaviors you observed that you thought were positive or negative, how those behaviors will impact the outcome of their work, and recommendations for what to do in in the future.'
        reinforceTip4: 'Recommend professional development opportunities that are optional and personalized. When a direct report is in the driver’s seat guiding development at their own pace, it can promote motivation (similar to coaching!) which will in turn lead to greater clarity and readiness.'
        resources: Resources
        setStage: '<strong>Set the stage for ongoing support.</strong> It’s likely that your direct report will want to continue to check in with you on their progress. Let them know this is welcome, and that they can reach out to you anytime they’d like to use time in your 1:1.'
        support: '4. Demonstrate support'
        supportBlurb: 'Expressing support for your direct report’s development shows that they are a valued member of your team and sets the expectation that they can dedicate time and energy to the coaching process. Coaching, like most other forms of development, only allows you to get out what you put into the process. As a manager, you can inspire your direct reports to perform at a level that they would have never imagined of themselves by expressing your confidence in their capabilities and encouraging them to continually learn.'
        supportList: 'Here are a few specific ways to offer support:'
        supportList1: 'Encourage your direct report to take time for coaching and professional development within working hours.'
        supportList2: 'Provide honest positive feedback when you observe high quality performance or progress.'
        supportList3: 'Point out strengths that you notice in your direct report. Let them know how their strengths contribute to the overall goals of your team and your organization.'
        supportList4: 'Offer your time, expertise, or resources to help support your direct report’s personal growth.'
        supportTip: 'People are impacted by the expectations that others have for them. This is known by psychologists as the Pygmalion effect. Help others to be their best self and you may be surprised at what they can achieve.'
        sustaining: 'Step 4: Sustaining'
        sustainingBlurb: 'The sustaining phase of the appreciative inquiry process is the final stage and is focused on making the plans a reality through execution and adaptation. The inquiry process at this stage is focused on developing clear and actionable steps to take in order to bring the vision into reality.'
        sustainingFooter: 'It is important for you as a manager to cultivate the enthusiasm and vision of others rather than drive the process. The sustaining force behind the inquiry process is not your authority but the positive emotions that pursuing a meaningful challenge creates.'
        sustainingQuestion: 'Example questions for this stage:'
        sustainingQuestion1: 'What would a step-by-step plan be for accomplishing this goal?'
        sustainingQuestion2: 'What can you do today to begin the process of making this vision a reality?'
        sustainingQuestion3: 'What needs to happen in order for your vision to come to fruition?'
        sustainingQuestion4: 'What potential roadblocks might come up and how will you address them?'
        sustainingQuestion5: 'How can you hold yourself accountable for following through?'
        sustainingTip: 'Execution can be challenging, however if you are able to hold onto the inspiring vision throughout all the stages success is far more likely.'

The questions were designed to enable a precise awareness of the current levels of belongingness in your organization and support the close tracking of those levels over time. We use a 100-point standardized scale based on where your employees fall relative to other professionals, with scores above 50 representing above average and scores less than 50 representing below average, compared to benchmarks.'
