[Lokalise is a translation management system](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400427-what-is-lokalise), which is designed to make the process of localization faster and easier.

Usually, there are two ways for any translator to join Lokalise:

1.  You've received the invitation link via email. If that's the case then itâ€™s all good: just proceed to the next section.
    
2.  You were told about us, but you donâ€™t have the invitation link. In this case, when you click **Try it for free** on `lokalise.com` and choose the option **Looking to join an existing team instead** you will see the message:
    

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225254103/b8327ce4027b30d35ef7e44d/2.png?expires=1620654045&signature=aa2ab8e8e3cf0cc077dee8b4e3b80f31461e02dd9a0d5c67b1ff2054cdef98fa)

Ask your project manager/team administrator for an invitation link and then accept the invitation.

If you don't have any team yet and you would like to test drive Lokalise features, then activate a [free trial](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/5170163-trial-period). To achieve that, simply register with your email and name, and then take advantage of all our goodies within the next two weeks. When the trial ends, you will be switched to a [free plan](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400453-free-plan) automatically.

_Please note: you don't need to verify your email additionally. After registering at Lokalise, you can proceed to your project right away._

Your profile
------------

To [change your personal details](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/5166507-managing-your-profile), click on your avatar in the bottom left corner and then proceed to **Personal profile**. Here you can change your name, email, password, and other settings. If you are an SDL Trados/Memsource user, you can choose the respective [hotkey (shortcuts) profile](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3095792-editor-hotkey-profiles-keyboard-shortcuts) there.

Please note that Lokalise employs Gravatar, a globally recognized avatar. Therefore, in order to manage your profile picture, you'll have to visit [gravatar.com](https://en.gravatar.com/) and create a new account with the same email as the one used on Lokalise.

Projects page
-------------

After logging in to the system, you should see something like this:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/389210741/e9a4c22e068bc967c66d6597/2021-09-14+15_49_46-Lokalise+_+App+localization.+Translation+platform%2C+services+-+tools.+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+F.png)

This is the [projects dashboard](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1458324-dashboard) and it shows the projects that you're a member of. For each project, a short summary is provided:

*   **Project completion** â€” you can track the overall progress here.
    
*   **Base words** â€” theÂ total word count of this project. In Lokalise, a **base language** means **source language**. It is marked with a small dot near the language flag. Sometimes, base language may be marked as done with less than 100% completion. Itâ€™s because there could be a translation key with an empty value there.
    
*   **Keys** â€” the total number of keys in this project. Keys are unique identifiers that are used for representing pieces of text in the code, in files or elsewhere.
    
*   **QA issues** â€” you can click and track any issue that our automatic checker has found. These may be grammar/spelling errors, translation reviewing issues, etc.
    

Apart from looking at the overall project info, you can track the progress of each relevant language separately. If you click on the language, you will be able to edit it in a [bilingual mode](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2107440-multilingual-view-and-bilingual-view). In this mode, you can focus on translating one language at a time.

Interface overview
------------------

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418682440/01f974c8c9e4bcd5c649dd2b/4.png)

The project used in this guide is called a _Sample Project_. Your project may look different, but all the main features and menu options will be nearly the same (certain elements might be hidden in your case due to the lack of permissions). Weâ€™ll cover all features step-by-step, but hereâ€™s a quick overview of the Lokalise interface:

*   **Project name** â€“ our project is called _Sample Project_.Â 
    
*   **Available languages** â€“ here you can see the number of languages you will be working with. If you click on any of the flags, you will see the translation progress for the language selected. In the screenshot above you can see a number of languages including: _English_ as a source language; _Chinese, French, German_, and some other target languages (those you will translate into). The languages are added by your project manager.
    
*   **Tasks** â€“ this is where you can check any [tasks assigned to you](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1457148-incoming-task-widget).
    
*   **Project chat** â€“ no need to switch between tabs and windows, you can [chat](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400643-comments-and-chat) with your team right here.
    
*   **Your avatar** â€“ you might be added to more than one [team](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400449-teams-and-roles), so here you can check your current team and other teams available to you. Also, by clicking on the avatar you can manage your personal profile.
    
*   **Amount of keys** â€“ keys are unique identifiers that are used for representing text strings in the code, in files or elsewhere. Each key has the corresponding translations for each language that is added to the project.
    
*   **Base (or source) language** â€“ this is the main language that you will translate from.
    
*   **Languages and places for translation** â€“ here you can see the languages you will be working with. Just click on the text field next to the language name and start translating.

Tasks
-----

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/334983245/4905f7719a29256ac8cdd380/2021-05-10+15_44_31-Demo+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png?expires=1620654045&signature=f81af91dacf70939a121633f211d4cf40ec2ec6e98ac5b8a761e1b44c18f3b35)

Once someone assigns a task to you, you'll see a notification in the [task inbox](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1457148-incoming-task-widget). In addition, you may receive a notification via email. For each task you can track the progress, see the due date and the task description.Â There are two types of tasks:

*   Translation â€” you are expected to perform translations into one or more languages.
    
*   Review â€” you are expected to check the existing translations and set their [status to "Reviewed"](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3684557-translation-statuses-translated-verified-reviewed-and-completed). To achieve that, simply click on the "Glasses" icon next to the translation (check a screenshot below).
    

Click on the language name in the task inbox and it will open the editor with all the items from this task. Alternatively, click on the word count ("Words to do") to open only the uncompleted keys.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225255839/45e646f98d78e13cacf95c11/6.png?expires=1620654045&signature=22915a6588fa33e686a9b6fd91534daa90936dd6f9183aebbe8df4f35ae5cc00)

Task-related fields are marked with small orange circles. Once you translate one of the items (or set its status to "Reviewed", depending on the task type), the orange circle will turn to a checkmark meaning that this item is completed. You can click on the checkmark to set the item status back to "uncompleted".

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/251572517/9bfbdfa5851e9fa74a09680b/8.5.png?expires=1620654045&signature=c9843005b1e4ffbc086d4551dae8e8d26e0b92e60f4fa87f680345b8870425bf)

"Words to do" counters are updated automatically as you mark the items as completed. Depending on the configuration of the task set by the creator, you may need to either manually mark a language as done, or it will be marked as done automatically.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120357088/4bede29884150acf3dcaff75/whistespace2.png?expires=1620654045&signature=a3f6f22e2ab563d036ff1309dd7e959c07e59ce982fafcbda63501cc02378c0f)

Options and features
--------------------

### Filter

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225256168/a6dd1ac29e7951b1b94b9d77/7.png?expires=1620654045&signature=5dc2695c1deba6f587d38eac18077780b9bdebb5f2c2ba2c838f327d53930b04)

Lokalise offers a wide range of [filtering options](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400616-filter). You can choose one of the existing filters or you can create a new filter and customize it in any way you like.Â 

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120360742/c22dc5c6d63d05c9484fbe9a/space.png?expires=1620654045&signature=b3645676347e325bec39dcaa89a5a5596dce82d341b248172ee7f83ae6c2c06a)

### Sort

You can use the **Sort by** option and list all the keys in the order you prefer.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/401543844/5f7e87f48e02856d7480a8fd/2021-10-10+19_08_08-Sample+Project+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)

  

### Multilingual and bilingual view

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418683012/dca47bf5c27040fac897c4c6/2021-10-10+17_31_25.png)

[Multilingual view](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2107440-multilingual-view-and-bilingual-view) allows you to see and translate multiple languages at the same time. You can see the languages listed one after another.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418684249/c17c7196c951662a39908a49/2021-10-10+17_33_46.png)

[Bilingual view](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2107440-multilingual-view-and-bilingual-view) slightly changes the interface. It allows you to focus on translating one language at a time. If you want to switch to another language, you can simply change the source or the target language in the top menu using one of the dropdowns.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418684506/17b7387307bf5215bd92b534/2021-10-10+17_35_13.png)

There is also a **Focus mode** available in the Bilingual view, which removes all info except for the translations (check the screenshot above).

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120361454/65142d424d3f818d372b10e2/space.png?expires=1620654045&signature=bbcda1c4917036c62d59a2aaabef49adb7d1b5c6b9b93d09ef0c1fc875aa592b)

### Remember position

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/401526134/cd2bbf18a1db81b64625fc8e/2021-10-10+17_37_38.png)

You donâ€™t have to worry about wasting time trying to find the exact place where you stopped working. We have a bookmark feature: just enable the **Remember position in project** option. As you can see on the screenshot above, the blue scrollbar tracks the current position.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120361507/77f956fbaf972fecea112d1d/space.png?expires=1620654045&signature=cbf25e1c89b83ad2a37f246c0d957f2e74cce102a1098400d9c6ff42df6c0c10)

### Display placeholders as blocks

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418684832/bcf341e40d74126a848466da/2021-10-10+17_48_33.png)

For your convenience, we offer a [Display placeholders as block](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2442504-html-placeholders-in-blocks) option. You can choose to view the placeholders in their original form such as `<strong></strong>` or you can turn them into blocks, so they donâ€™t distract you. In addition, our [QA tool](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2564656-qa-checks) will automatically warn you if you forgot to insert placeholders while performing translations.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120361535/6ed5d536ddf05b5ae2719386/space.png?expires=1620654045&signature=260f4eaf19331feb88b969b3069d034b60faa823c7ff2d5018a3a00a10627f05)

### Display grammar errors

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418685107/5fc0c1f10a8fba065054ed0c/2021-10-10+17_58_24.png)

The display [spelling and grammar errors](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1478623-spelling-and-grammar-check) function enables or disables the underlining of words with spelling or grammar mistakes. If you decide to turn it off, our QA checker still will warn you (check the orange triangle in the screenshot above), but wonâ€™t underline the word.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120361573/5e0a8d79eff3c8fec84fadbf/space.png?expires=1620654045&signature=35a7674a11f409049ce64b15f76d5394e40b9ce55d4356d7d56b227ab76dbafb)

### QA checker

**Missing placeholders**

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/401530694/5ca603095cbdd8aff8e83634/2021-10-10+18_01_39.png)

The **Missing placeholders** QA check will warn you with a red circle. If you click on it, you will see which placeholders are missing in your translation and will be able to add them accordingly.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/120361643/c7279fb814365d9c13cca3e5/space.png?expires=1620654045&signature=c523b045aa8d39ee18632f8551c94a60f35ba0a60a7c91c991e80490837b76e7)

**Grammar and spelling**

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418685479/e6c4838acfd517fc618eb1b6/2021-10-10+18_03_48.png)

If a spelling or grammar mistake was found, our QA checker will warn you with an orange triangle. You can click on it to see the detailed explanation.

Please note that your project manager may enable other [quality assurance checks](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2564656-qa-checks).

### Translation Memory

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/382948974/96839bb02fa2a4f5182d2526/2021-08-31+14_48_11-Demo+Phoenix+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)

This feature is extremely useful if you are working on more than one project. Our [translation memory](https://blog.lokalise.com/localization-and-translation-glossary-terms/#translationmemory) remembers the accepted translations and offers them for you in other projects. There are two ways to view translation memory entries.

The translation suggestion will be displayed automatically when you click on the translation field:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/382937015/36d80fce682e67e3bdc07476/2021-08-31+14_23_22-Demo+Phoenix+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)

You can click on the **Translation Memory** button (or bring it up using `Ctrl+G` key combination) and search for translations manually:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/401543957/b03c37ec0c69139306a1c752/2021-10-10+19_08_58-Sample+Project+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)

Please note that translation memory entries will be displayed based on the projects you have access to.

_Note: this feature might be disabled in your project._

### Machine translation

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225257733/9b8da005626252fb8d173598/20.png?expires=1620654045&signature=e1aca83614d546838571af8451517d5df7a053ef07804bdaa64f14ecfa5a64f2)

Sometimes you just donâ€™t want to leave empty translations, or want to save time by employing [machine translation](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/5166158-machine-translation) and then editing it manually. We offer several automatic translation services like Google, DeepL, and Microsoft. Feel free to choose the option that suits you best!

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225257782/a8f9c1ca6e3fdc7b621032cd/21.png?expires=1620654045&signature=a92775e35a10749946273a79a3cef7a9c645d1577ffcc60589db0ea5dda9abf5)

You can also click **Google-translate empty values** button to populate all empty values for the given key using Google Translate service.

### Translation upvoting

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225257847/56c2a3b2d78bb5922461ea3d/22.png?expires=1620654045&signature=76c80b21b334fb4ffada20a6a0ae4e0514fbac14adcdd170d2d5075c5d52e3da)

If your project has multiple translators for the same language, you can collaborate and vote for the most suitable translation version. The translation with the most [upvotes](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400631-translation-upvoting) will be applied automatically.

_Note: this feature might be disabled in your project._

### Inline suggestions appearance

Starting from January 2022, all suggestions are displayed in the right pane by default:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/451079862/c7bdfa4681283b4af356a188/2022-01-19+19_55_58-Sample+Project+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)

However, you can adjust this behaviour and make then appear underneath the editor like it was done previously. To control where the suggestions should be displayed, proceed to [your profile](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/5166507-managing-your-profile), open the **General** tab, and toggle the **Display in side panel** option:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/451076549/c25c539991af1d4a0681e3c5/2022-01-19+19_50_43-Lokalise+_+App+localization.+Translation+platform%2C+services+-+tools.+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+F.png)

### Screenshots

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/225257943/e0e5786d76ca09260b9ef825/23.png?expires=1620654045&signature=e697760dc10873f805e2a4806388d52a2393917f28410e6951e862107e1c1deb)

Improve the translation quality and reduce ambiguity with the [screenshots](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2045882-screenshots) feature. Your project manager can upload screenshots or pictures which will help you understand the context. These screenshots can be linked to individual keys and the relevant screenshot portion can be highlighted as well.

_Note: this feature might be disabled in your project._

### Project chat

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418687022/6f700befbc0ef78f4b94c9e6/2021-10-10+17_58_21.png)

You can chat [with your team](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1400643-comments-and-chat) within Lokalise itself. Also you can enable email notifications for chat messages.

### History

To check [translation history](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/2107561-translation-history) and identify any problematic activities to resolve, click the **History** button:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/382942218/c3c0140fddf9c2fd8c984c97/2021-08-31+14_35_54-Demo+Phoenix+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)

_Note: this feature might be disabled in your project._

### Glossary

Some words should stay the same in all languages, for example, company names. Some words can have special meaning. Our **Glossary** allows you to add any words that require special treatment.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/418687695/7ebb0fb9bf40e820eb0bbd30/2021-11-14+17_52_45.png)

Also, there are some words which have more than one meaning. You can add these to [glossary](https://blog.lokalise.com/localization-and-translation-glossary-terms/#glossary) too and write a short explanation.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/404333657/d29d2aaefddc38ff1b803811/2021-10-15+19_40_18-Blog+_+Lokalise+%E2%80%94+Mozilla+Firefox.png)
